Dr. Tommy Parker provided the data and many of the ideas for the project while Michael Brown, Joel Cambon, Rachel Determann, and Jimmy Murphy developed the software code. 
Development started in Spring 2012 and then it was agreed--by the developers--to be released under the terms of the GPLv3 in 2014.
